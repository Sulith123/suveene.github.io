  We started off clocking in almost at a speedy 5km/h. The plan? Cover the first leg as fast as humanly possible.

<p className="my-1">
  At the 10km mark, we had a quick pit stop for snacks and drinks.
</p>

        <p className="my-1">
          Then came our dinner at Spring Leaf Prata at West Coast. We had Pratas, biriyani and some drinks to fuel up for the rest of the journey.
          Some of us (yes, including me) even popped paracetamol, prepping for the pain that was to come. 
        </p>
        <p className="my-1">
        Fresh socks, blister tape, and a hearty meal had us raring to go for the next leg, but the extended break made it tricky to keep up our initial pace.
